# weeb-native
Notes-
Please ignore -
## First Version v1:
1. Okay okay that's kind of a cringe name for a project but I am bad at naming projects so here you go.
2. So First version of the app is a basic anime info app containing features like -
1. User can view diff. type of anime based on seasons and all a carousel for the same.
2. Contains a slider for displaying the upcoming anime's.
3. You can view their details and also can view the trailer this one is kind of tricky as you can't view yt-based videos on native without using shitty libraries with shitty UI. so the demo contains only a demo video.
4. Also you can search anime huh that's badass.
I will basically change the whole app basic point bc from this point it's simply an info app I want to convert it into a whole-fledged watching anime app but hey not bad for the first time, also my god i have to like use many libs for diff thing trying which one works better and don't give me a headache.
